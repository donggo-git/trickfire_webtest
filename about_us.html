                            efficient autonomous lunar mining rover. The team
                            works year-round to design, manufacture, and test
                            the rover, just in time to travel to Kennedy Space

                            The finance team is the backbone of the backbone of
                            TrickFire's technical side. Their goal is to secure
                            funding for everything that is done in the team - to
                            build a rover can cost tens of thousands of dollars.
                            It is the job of this team to plan years in advance
                            to ensure the coffers are always filled, either by
                            applying for grants or finding industry sponsors.

                            If a robotics team makes a rover, but no one knows
                            about it, was the rover really built? Our outreach

                            backbone of TrickFire’s technical side includes:
