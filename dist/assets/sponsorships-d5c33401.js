Ordering what we need through university funding can take weeks. For the vast majority of our parts and materials budget, we must submit a list of what we need a year in advance; purchases must be made from that list. With your donation, you will directly impact the development of our students by removing the red tape that hampers the club. Our team strives for professional quality work; your support will enable professional procurement. In-kind sponsorships are one great way to help our team get much-needed resources and tools to help construct the robot. In addition to monetary and in-kind donations, we seek industry mentors. As such, working with your organization’s professionals provides invaluable experience that helps us reach that goal while giving you a direct connection to candidate employees </p></div></div></header>',1),h={class:"my-5 mx-auto sponsorship__howToSponsor"};function m(d,u,f,k,b,w){const s=i("row_blocks");return r(),t(p,null,[_,a("div",h,[n(s,{image__left:"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TrickfireRobotics/TrickfireRobotics.github.io/dev/src/assets/Trickfire_image/slanted_image/sponsorship/slanted_teaching_new_member.png",image__left__responsive:"https://github.com/TrickfireRobotics/TrickfireRobotics.github.io/blob/dong/sponsorship/src/assets/Trickfire_image/original_image/unused/unslanted_teaching_new_member.jpg?raw=true",text:"Please contact us at tfrbtcs@uw.edu if you are interested in sponsoring TrickFire Robotics.
