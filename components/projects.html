                            The NASA Robotics Mining Competition is a
                            competition hosted by NASA, where fifty teams across
                            the United States compete to build the best rover
                            that can mine under a simulated surface of the moon.
                            A rover starts at the home base, navigates through
                            obstacles, and then reaches a mining zone where it
                            has to break through a few layers. It then digs out
                            regolith (gravel) and transports it back to the home
                            base, where it deposits the regolith. The process is
                            repeated multiple times.

                            In six years, TrickFire has built four different
                            rovers, nearly building a new one for each year's
                            competition.

                            Houdini, the most recent build, is the third

                            shifted its focus to Lunar mining. In response, our

                            size, while being able to mine 20% deeper due to our
                            redesign of the arms kinematics.

                            fundamental design is the same as Grimlock’s, the
                            team completely overhaled the rover by adding in a

                            bin, and redesigning the drivetrain suspension. As a

                            now weighs in at 67 kilograms, a significant

                            thirty centimeters underneath. Grimlock boasted a

                            truck style bin that was used to transport the mined
                            regolith, and tank treads that can drive over any
                            obstacle that could be thrown at it. With an
